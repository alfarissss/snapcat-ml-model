![Cover Readme API ML](https://github.com/alfarissss/snapcat-ml-api/assets/134893804/b0365706-085e-4098-9b39-ce65332caca0)

## Files in the Repository
1. Dataset file
2. Model file (model.h5)
3. Jupyter Notebook file

## Dataset 
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shawngano/gano-cat-breed-image-collection/data)
- We also try to make data augmentation using python in local folder so the image can bigger than dataset from kaggle. [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19ix5COwJvpmAMcWRIXlZrXCngih-ts7s?usp=sharing)

## Model
The model used is SSD EfficientnetB0 for Cat Breeds Detection. You can find the model file (model.h5) in this repository.

## Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook contains the code for training the model. This model gets an accuracy that can be said to be high, for 97% accuracy and 91% val_accuracy.  You can find the notebook file in this repository.

## How to Use the Model
To use this model, you can clone this repository and load the model using the keras library in Python or you can running .ipynb on your computer using google collab, jupyter notebook or other.
